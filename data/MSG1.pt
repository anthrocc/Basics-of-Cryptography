VALUATIONS OF SECRECY SYSTEM

There are a number of different criteria that should be applied in estimating the value of a proposed secrecy system.
The most important of these are:

Amount of Secrecy
There are some systems that are perfect: the enemy is no better off after intercepting any amount of material than before.
Other systems, although giving him some information, do not yield a unique solution to intercepted cryptograms. Among 
the uniquely solvable systems, there are wide variations in the amount of labor required to effect this solution and in
the amount of material that must be intercepted to make the solution unique.

Size of Key
The key must be transmitted by non-interceptible means from transmitting to receiving points. Sometimes it must be
memorized. It is therefore desirable to have the key as small as possible.

Complexity of Enciphering and Deciphering Operations
Enciphering and deciphering should, of course, be as simple as possible. If they are done manually, complexity leads to
loss of time, errors, etc. If done mechanically, complexity leads to large expensive machines.

Propagation of Errors
In certain types of ciphers an error of one letter in enciphering or transmission leads to a large number of errors in
the deciphered text. The error are spread out by the deciphering operation, causing the loss of much information and
frequent need for repetition of the cryptogram. It is naturally desirable to minimize this error expansion.
