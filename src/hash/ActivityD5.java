    With x people in a room, compute the probability S that at least two of them have the same birthday as follows (ignore leap years):
        a)  Do the calculation exactly by subtracting 1 from the probability of all birthdays being different.
        b)  Use the approximation: 1 - x = e-x (valid for small x) to express S as:
            1 - e-x2/(2N)
            where N=365 is the number of days in the year.
        c)  Show that S becomes â‰¥ 50% when x >= 1.177*sqrt(N)
        d)  Pick a value for x and verify the correctness of the above analysis experimentally. Hint: Monte Carlo.
