The SKD protocol of the previous question is not secure. Show that it is possible for any node N on the network to
eavesdrop on and understand the conversation between A and B.
Hint: capture the first exchange; modify it; and then replay it.

ANSWER
Malory does not block any messages at all; she simply takes copies of them. Hence the protocol continues as normal as
if Malory wasn't there and A and B will talk and exchange lots of messages (encrypted with KS) without getting any
malformed message. Malory eavesdrops on all these ciphertexts and she simply records them (takes copies of them) even
though she cannot decrypt them at this stage. Once A and B syp talking and their session ends, she sends the replayed
first message to the KDC (as you explained) and thus gets KS. She uses it to decrypt all the ciphertexts she recorded
earlier.
