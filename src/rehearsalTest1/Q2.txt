------Questions------
A) What would you do in order to determine if the cipher is a transposition cipher or not?
B) What would you do in order to determine if the cipher is a Caesar cipher or not?
C) What would you do in order to determine if the cipher is a monoalphabetic cipher or not?
D) What would you do in order to determine if the cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher or not?



------Answers------
A) Check the frequency vectors of the CipherText and if it is close to English (0.7), it is most likley transposition.
B) Simply try all 25 possible shifts and if one of them gives a plaintext that is English, it is a Caesar cipher.
C) Calculate the index of coincidence and if it is around 0.06, it is most likely monoalphabetic (after ruling out that
it is not a transposition cipher).
D) Calculate the index of coincidence and if it is lower than 0.06, it is most likely polyalphabetic (after ruling out
that it is not a transposition cipher).
